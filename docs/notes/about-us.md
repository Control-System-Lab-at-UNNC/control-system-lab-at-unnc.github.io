### Content

The Control Systems Laboratory is dedicated to advancing control theory, system modeling, and their applications in challenging environments. Our research primarily focuses on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), ground robotics, additive manufacturing, and industrial automation. We explore novel actuation techniques for dynamic interactions, design innovative solutions to enhance system mobility and versatility, and develop cutting-edge control and optimization algorithms for motion and manipulation.

Drawing inspiration from applied mathematics and bionics, we aim to foster robust and autonomous control systems capable of thriving in real-world scenarios. Our work strives to create intelligent solutions for complex systems, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in the field of control engineering.
